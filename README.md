## Maplibre-React-Library

In this project, my goal will be to write the Maplibre library, which is an npm package, as react components.

## Notes
prepare — runs before the package is packed and published. Runs on local npm install without any arguments,

prepublishOnly — runs before the package is prepared and packed, only on npm publish. Here will be our tests.



``npm publish --dry-run``
